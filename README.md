# Definition of Done

>The **definition of done** is exactly what you think: a list of criteria that has to be met before any work can be considered **done**. _Failure to meet any one of these conditions means the work is not complete_.

## Why?
At **_dwyl_**, we consider the _definition of done_ to be one of the most important parts of a project [if not **_the_ most important**](https://github.com/dwyl/summer-2015/issues/42).

Having this means that everyone who works with dwyl **knows what to aim for** in terms of code quality which facilitates the integration with the rest of our codebase and _saves everyone time_, which is of course [our stated aim](https://github.com/dwyl/start-here/blob/master/manifesto.md)!

## Definition of Done
We will keep adding detail and examples to this as we gain understanding of any ambiguities that come up.

For clarity, a task/pull request will not be considered to be complete until all these items can be checked off.
* [ ] Task has its own **GitHub issue** (something it is solving)
  * [ ] **Estimate of expected time** required to complete task was agreed with all present and recorded **before starting the task**
  * [ ] Issue number is **included in the commit messages** for traceability
* [ ] **Record actual time taken** for the task in the PR
* [ ] **Update the README.md** with any changes/additions made
* [ ] Your code follows the [**dwyl style guide**](https://github.com/dwyl/style-guide)
* [ ] **100% test coverage**
* [ ] **All tests pass**
